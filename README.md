## Introduction

Welcome to the [MovieHub Backend repository](https://github.com/ivanlomoro/moviehub-nextjs-backend), a crucial component of the MovieHub application designed for movie list management. The project has been restructured into two separate repositories â€“ one for the backend and another for the frontend. This repository is dedicated to the backend, developed using Next.js, and is deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/) for robust hosting. Additionally, [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is integrated for efficient media storage.

## Features

- Powerful backend operations for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) on movies.
- Seamless integration with the [frontend](https://github.com/ivanlomoro/moviehub-nextjs) for a cohesive user experience.
- User authentication and authorization through [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
- Support for multiple databases â€“ MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
- Enhanced server-side rendering and performance with Next.js.
- Hosted on Railway for efficient backend deployment and management.
- Media storage and management through [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Familiarity with backend development concepts.
- Access to the [MovieHub Frontend repository](https://github.com/ivanlomoro/moviehub-nextjs).
